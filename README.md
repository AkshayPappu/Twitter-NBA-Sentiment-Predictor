# Twitter-NBA-Sentiment-Predictor
## Description:
This project harnesses the power of the Twitter API and machine learning techniques to provide real-time predictions for NBA games. Leveraging a Random Forest model and incorporating advanced feature engineering with Twitter data, the predictor ensures accurate and up-to-date insights into game outcomes.

## Key Features:

### Twitter 
API Integration: Collects relevant data from Twitter, focusing on sentiments related to NBA teams.
Machine Learning Model: Utilizes a Random Forest model to analyze Twitter sentiments and make predictions.
Real-Time Predictions: The predictor offers real-time game predictions based on the latest available Twitter data.
Feature Engineering: Enhances model accuracy through thoughtful feature engineering techniques.
Temporal Considerations: Gathers data within a week before each game to ensure predictions are made using the most recent and relevant information.
How It Works:

### Data Collection: 
Twitter API is employed to gather tweets related to NBA teams within a week leading up to a game.
Feature Engineering: The collected data undergoes feature engineering, extracting valuable insights for model training.
Random Forest Model: The machine learning model, based on the Random Forest algorithm, processes the engineered features to predict game outcomes.
Real-Time Updates: Predictions are provided in real time, offering users the most current insights into upcoming NBA games.
Benefits:

### Up to Date Predictions: 
Users can make informed decisions based on the latest sentiment analysis.
Model Accuracy: Advanced feature engineering and a robust machine learning model contribute to accurate predictions.
Open Source: The project is open-source, inviting collaboration and improvement from the community.
